# ValidatorManager
Note about how to make a series of reusable validators and how to manage them.

## Design
[Basic design](ValidatorManager/Basic)  
[Simple design](ValidatorManager/Simple)  
[Standard design](ValidatorManager/Standard)  
[Advance design](ValidatorManager/Advance)  
[Complex design](ValidatorManager/Complex)  

**Finally...[Back to basic and simpler](ValidatorManager/BackToBasic)**

## Tests
Some tests on Program.cs and Tests.cs. No test framwork applied becuase it is just a sample project for design and concept.
